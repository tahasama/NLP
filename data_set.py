    "What is the value of x in the equation 2x + 3 = 9?": "To solve for x, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. First, subtract 3 from both sides to get 2x = 6. Then, divide both sides by 2 to get x = 3.",
    "How do you solve a linear equation?": "A linear equation is an equation of the form ax + b = c, where a, b, and c are constants, and x is the variable. To solve it, isolate the variable x by performing operations to both sides of the equation.",
    "What is the quadratic formula?": "The quadratic formula is used to find the solutions to a quadratic equation of the form ax^2 + bx + c = 0. It is given by x = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / (2a).",
    "Can you explain factoring polynomials?": "Factoring polynomials involves expressing a polynomial as a product of its factors. It's often used to solve equations or simplify expressions.",
    "How do you find the slope of a line?": "The slope of a line is determined by the ratio of the change in y-coordinates to the change in x-coordinates between two points on the line."
